        <h2>Content One</h2>
        <p>Earth has never been perfectly round. The planet bulges around the equator by an extra 0.3 percent as a result of the fact that it rotates about its axis. 
            Earth's diameter from North to South Pole is 12,714 kilometers (7,900 miles), while through the equator it is 12,756 kilometers (7,926 miles).</p>
        
        <h3>Content Two</h3>
        <p>The length of Earth's day is increasing. When Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago, its day would have been roughly six hours long. By 620 million years ago, this had increased to 21.9 hours.
             Today, the average day is 24 hours long, but is increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds every century.</p>
